for 9 servings

FILLING

1 tablespoon olive oil
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 white onion, diced
2 cups (250 g) chicken, cooked, shredded
½ teaspoon paprika, or cayenne pepper
salt, to taste
4 oz (110 g) cream cheese
3 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped


DOUGH

1 tablespoon unsalted butter
2 cups (470 mL) whole milk
¼ cup (60 mL) chicken broth
2 cups (250 g) all-purpose flour
egg
2 cups (100 g) panko breadcrumbs
oil, for frying 

Preparation


In a medium pot, heat olive oil, then sauté garlic and onions until soft and brown. Add shredded chicken, salt, and paprika (or cayenne pepper). Stir to incorporate.
Transfer mixture into a bowl, add cream cheese and parsley. Mix well.
In the same pot, add butter, chicken broth, and milk. Bring to a boil. Stir in flour until dough is formed.
Transfer dough to a flat surface. Knead the dough while it is warm, but not hot.
Pinch a piece of dough, about the size of a large egg, and roll into a ball. Using your hands, flatten the dough and spoon filling into the center. Wrap the dough into a pear shape and make sure there aren’t any holes.
While heating a pot of oil to 350˚F/180˚C, dredge the dough in egg and panko, then deep-fry till golden brown and cooked through.
Drain on a towel, or wire rack and serve immediately.
Enjoy!
